## **Mini Project**
This mini project is designed to help you consolidate everything learned from Week 1 to Week 4 before we resume model building in January.

⚠️ Note: You are NOT required to train any machine learning model yet.
The focus is on data preparation, feature engineering, and model reasoning/thinking (conceptual).

### **📌 Project Structure**

This mini project has two parts:

Part 1: Practice on the dataset you've been working on

Part 2: Apply skills to a brand-new dataset

## 🔹 **Part 1 — Feature Engineering & Model Thinking (Practice)**
Dataset

[🏪 Warehouse and Retail Sales – Montgomery County](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samanfatima7/warehouse-and-retail-sales-montgomery-county)

You have already:

   - Cleaned the dataset

   - Handled missing values

   - Parsed dates

   - Performed EDA and visualization

This part focuses on the next stage of the data science workflow.

### **🎯 Tasks (Part 1)**

- Feature Engineering

- Create at least 3 new meaningful features

   Examples:

     - Date-based features (day, month, year)

     - Aggregated features (e.g. total sales per category)

- Encoding Decisions

     - Identify which columns need encoding

     - State the type of encoding you would use and why
      (No need to implement the code)

- Scaling Decisions

     - Identify which numerical features may need scaling. 

- Model Thinking

     - Identify a suitable target variable

     - State the problem type and explain your reasoning in 3–5 sentences

## **🔹Part 2 — End-to-End Data Preparation (New Dataset)**
Dataset

📊 Housing Dataset

### **🎯 Tasks (Part 2)**

Apply everything learned from Week 1 to Week 4:

- Initial Data Inspection

    - Check shape, columns, data types

    - Identify missing values (if any)

- Data Cleaning

    - Handle missing values appropriately (if any)

    - Fix incorrect data types

    - Remove duplicates (if any)

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   - Perform basic univariate and bivariate analysis

   - Create at least 2 visualizations

   - Write short insights (1–2 sentences each)

- Feature Engineering, Scaling and Encoding 

   - Create at least 2 new features

   - Identify the columns that would be scales and those that would be encoded.

- Model Recommendation

   - Identify a target variable

   - State the problem type and recommend what type of model will be used (regression, classification or clustering)


### **📤 Submission Instructions**

Ensure your notebook is:

  - Well-structured: divide it into part 1 and part 2 

  - Clearly documented

  - Easy to follow

  - Push your notebook to your GitHub repository 

  - Submit to the [submission sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uIpd_jGrRRlQ1X9wx3XDzakWtKQ_cWMi7gB8eaQvXrs/edit?usp=sharing)
